  Cleanup Geometry - Calls on stored sketchup files and imports into City Engine.
  Apply Texture - Seems pretty self explanatory doesn't it.
  Extrude Philly - Extrudes building footprints to their max zoning height and colors codes them based on zoning code, energy usage, occupant density, property value, or custom.
